question: |
  Welcome to the Massachusetts Wage Theft Claim Helper!
subquestion: |
  This interview will help you complete Massachusetts Attorney General's [workplace complaint form](https://www.mass.gov/how-to/file-a-workplace-complaint).
  
  Before you begin, please consider the following points:
  
  1. Not all complaints lead to an investigation.
  2. If you do not request a **private right of action**, Massachusetts will investigate this claim as soon as it can, but it may take several weeks to decide if it will do so.
  3. If you request a **private right of action**, Massachusetts **will not** investigate this claim.
  4. If Massachusetts does investigate a claim, it may do any of the following:
  
  * send a warning to the employer
  * require your employer to pay unpaid wages and a penalty
  * file criminal charges against your employer
  * give you a **private right of action** that allows you to sue your employer for your unpaid wages 
  * take some other action to resolve any violations they find

  
  
  Press continue when you are ready to get started.
